Our project consists of an online library with the following functionalities:

* for a user: <br>
·       search for books <br>
·       see all books <br>
* for an admin:  <br>
·       add books to the database <br>
·       delete books from the database <br>
·       update books from the database <br>
·       see all books <br>
·       search for books <br>


The data stored in the database is related to the books:<br>
o   name <br>
o   author<br>
o   publisher-address, name<br>
o   year<br>
o   stock<br>
o   price<br>
 
The user and the admin can search for books depending on their name or author or publisher <br>

RESTful API design:<br>
Search for books:<br>
 ```sh
  GET /api/v1/books
  GET /api/v1/books/titleOfBook
  GET /api/v1/books/filter/author/authorOfBook
  GET /api/v1/books/filter/publisher/publisherOfBook 
  ```

Add book to database:
```
POST /api/v1/books/add_book/  //add book to database, where query is defined as a JSON with all the info packed with a header(Bearer <token>) to permit just the administrators to add books.
```
Delete book from database:
```
DELETE /api/v1/books/{id} //delete a book based on id
```
Update book from database
```
PUT /api/v1/books/{id} – update/resave() an entire book based on id
PATCH /api/v1/books/{id} – update the object with a few changed attribute’s value book based on id
```
